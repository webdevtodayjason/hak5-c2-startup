# Hak5 Cloud C2 Server Starter Script

## Overview
This project provides an easy-to-use shell script for starting the Hak5 Cloud C2 Server with the flexibility of configuration through an external file. The script uses `tmux` to run the server in a persistent session, allowing for easy management and reconnection.

Hak5 Cloud CÂ² simplifies deployment and management for penetration testers and IT security teams, enabling control of Hak5 devices from a central cloud dashboard.
